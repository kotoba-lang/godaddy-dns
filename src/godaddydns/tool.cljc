(ns godaddydns.tool
  "The DNS tool vocabulary over an `IDns`, as ordinary langchain tools
  (explicit input_schema, plain {:name :description :schema :fn} maps), so
  they work through langchain.model's Anthropic/OpenAI adapters as-is.

    list_domains   (read)
    list_records   (read)   {domain, type?, name?}
    upsert_record  (write)  {domain, type, name, data, ttl?}
    delete_record  (write)  {domain, type, name}

  Read tools always hit the IDns. Write tools are *gated* by `dry-run?`:
  when true they DO NOT mutate — they append the intended change to
  `plan-atom` and return a `PLANNED: …` string so the model (and the
  caller) can see exactly what would happen. When false they execute and
  return `APPLIED: …`. This is the safety default for a destructive
  surface (DNS): plan first, apply on explicit opt-in."
